        "## What are Regular Expressions?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Regular expressions** (often called \"regex\" or \"regexp\") are patterns that describe sets of strings. They're like a super-powered \"find and replace\" tool that can match complex patterns in text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why use regular expressions?**\n",
        "- Find specific patterns in text (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, dates)\n",
        "- Extract information from structured data\n",
        "- Validate that text matches a certain format\n",
        "- Replace patterns with other text\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Instead of searching for exact text like \"M-00001\", you could search for any pattern like \"M-\" followed by digits, which would match \"M-00001\", \"M-12345\", etc.\n",
