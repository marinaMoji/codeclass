        "## What is Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a **programming language** - a way to write instructions that tell a computer what to do. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, especially in:\n",
        "- **Data analysis and research** - Working with datasets, statistics, and scientific computing\n",
        "- **Web development** - Building websites and web applications\n",
        "- **Automation** - Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks\n",
        "- **Digital humanities** - Text analysis, working with historical documents, and research projects\n",

        "\n",
        "Python has several benefits that make it great for beginners and researchers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Readable** - Python code is designed to be easy to read, almost like English\n",
        "- **Simple syntax** - You don't need to memorize lots of special symbols or complex rules\n",
        "- **Powerful** - Despite being simple, Python can handle complex tasks\n",
        "- **Large community** - Lots of help available online when you get stuck\n",
        "- **Great for data** - Excellent tools for working with text, numbers, and files\n",
